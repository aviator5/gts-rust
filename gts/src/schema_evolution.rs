//! Type Schema Evolution Compatibility (spec sec 4.2, OP#8).
//!
//! Compares two definitions of one type identity by the instances they accept
//! and reports the backward, forward, and full verdicts. The relation is
//! `Valid(old) ⊆ Valid(new)` for backward and the reverse inclusion for
//! forward; sec 4.3 defines the modes.
//!
//! Derivation is a different relation over a different pair of schemas (sec
//! 4.1, `crate::schema_derivation`) and the spec is emphatic that the two must
//! not be conflated. What they share is the inclusion test itself, exposed
//! here as [`check_accepted_set_inclusion`] under a name that belongs to
//! neither relation.
